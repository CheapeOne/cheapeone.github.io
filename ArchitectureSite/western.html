                       This garden is covered mostly in water, a pond which contains a small island. Also known as the ‘Supplementary Garden’, it is only about half the size of the central garden. The main feature of this garden other than the pond is Mandarin Duck (Yuanyang) Hall, from which the pond’s ducks can be fed. This section is entered through a traditional 'moon gate'. From here, a series of meandering pathways follow the edge of the lake and link the various buildings of this garden together.

                    <p>At first glance this building seems to stand out from the other pavilions in the garden. It has a novel layout, with four small pavilions attached at the corners of the main building. This section is itself subdivided into northern and southern halves by a partition board. However, these features do not isolate the user from the rest of the garden. Instead, they integrate this building into the climate around it.</p>
                    <p>Here is how it works: different sides of the hall are meant to be used at different times of year. The north side receives less sunlight, and is preferable as a cool spot during the summer. It also faces the pond, allowing one to feed the ducks which occupy it during this time of year. The south side however faces the sun, and faces away from the water. Both of these act to keep the occupants comfortable during the fall and winter. 
</p>
                    <p>The flora around the hall is placed to take advantage of these two use cases. The pond to the north not only houses ducks but also a variety of lily plants. These bloom from June to August; perfect for the northern ‘summer’ side. Similarly, the southern ‘winter’ side faces a garden of camellias, which bloom from October to April. 
</p>
                    <p>Either side of the hall is covered with panels that can be opened to let the fragrance of the flowers inside. The aforementioned pagodas at the corners of the hall add additional surface area for fragrance to enter. They also could act as ‘turrets’ from which one can get a larger field of view of the surrounding landscape.

                    <p>This moon gate links the western and central gardens. This structure is highly symbolic within chinese culture, and is a common feature as an entryway. </p>
                    <p>One interpretation is that is represents the cyclical nature of the world. The portal itself is a circle, through which people come and go in a cycle. The sloping roof is supposed to represent the half moon of the chinese summer, connecting it into the cycle of the seasons. The slopes of the roof can also be seen as the flow of waves, air, or time. All of these connect into the Taoist philosophy of cycles of change, like those of the dynasties.
</p>
                    <p>Other than the portal, the flat stone wall is only penetrated by two ‘leaking windows’. These windows are filled with decorative patterns, and only give the user a tiny glimpse of the other side of the wall. This helps build anticipation for when they pass through to the other side.

                    <p>This structure incorporates a few common elements of the garden. Firstly, it’s zigzagging path give the user a variety of views of the garden. It also works to slow down their pace, making the journey across more meditative. 
 </p>
                    <p>The way the pathway dips down to the water adds to this effect. It seems like it is bending under its own weight, supported only by the natural rock formations on either side. The path must  submit to the forces of nature. This dip also serves the practical purpose of allowing the user to get closer to the pond to feed the ducks.

</p>
                    <p>The wall of the path is dotted with more ‘leaking windows’, giving glimpses to the central part of the garden. You can see that each window has a unique pattern, adding to the irregular and organic feel of the pathway.
